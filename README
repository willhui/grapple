Grapple
======================================

Window management is a pain in the neck. Why reach for the title
bar just to move your window? Why must you point your mouse at the
ultra-thin window borders to resize? It's needlessly cumbersome.

Grapple lets you move and resize windows with ease:

- Hold down ALT and left-drag anywhere on a window to move it around.
- Hold down ALT and right-drag anywhere on a window to resize it from
  the nearest corner.
- Hold down ALT and middle-click anywhere on a window to send it to
  the bottom of the stack of all open windows. Convenient for revealing
  everything below a certain window.

Grapple lets you use the entire window as the "target area" to
perform a move or resize operation. Try it for awhile, and you'll
never realize how useful it is until you find yourself on a computer
without it.

Grapple is designed to be extremely lightweight and unintrusive. When
it starts up, the only UI is an icon in the system tray that lets you
enable or disable Grapple. That's all there is to it.

Grapple runs on Win XP/Vista/7. It is a 32-bit application, but it
has been tested to work on x64 systems. (My own machine runs Win7 x64.)

Note that you need to run Grapple with administrator privileges in
order for Grapple to be able to influence other administrator apps.
